## Project coverage - 

The POC was aimed to get some hands on experience with Vue.js. The following topics were covered as part of this POC - 

1. Generator - vue-cli

2. Vue Directives - v-if, v-for, v-on, v-bind etc

3. Navigation/Routers - vue-router

4. CSS framework - Bulma: Alternative to Bootstrap or Foundation

5. Responsiveness - Desktop to mobile devices

6. HTTP Library - Axios: Alternative to vue-resource (Axios works well with Vue and is recommended)
